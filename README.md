## 1. Introduction

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks and files containing data related to the notebook demonstrating my work on the Fundamentals for Data Analysis Assessment. The assessment instructions required students to create a Jupyter notebook in relation to `pyplot` and a Jupyter notebook in relation to CAO Points. 

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.
```matplotlib.pyplot``` is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides a MATLAB-like way of plotting<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>.

The CAO website can be found [here](http://www.cao.ie/).

Specifically, the assessment instructions required:

- A README.md file
- A requirements.txt file
- A Jupyter notebook containing:
    - A clear and concise overview of the `matplotlib.pyplot` Python package
    - An in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the `matplotlib.pyplot` Python package
- A Jupter notebook containing:
    - A clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points information from the CAO website into a `pandas` data frame
    - A detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2021 using the functionality in `pandas`
    - Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook.

## 2. Assessment Description

The first notebook contains an overview of the `matplotlib.pyplot` Python package and an in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the package:

- Scatter plot
- Stacked area plot
- Bar plot

The plots used are taken from three different Python programming websites; the original code from each website for each plot is copied into this notebook and run to show the finished plot. A breakdown and description of the code is then provided which will explain how the code arrives at the finished plot.

The second notebook contains an overview of how to load CAO points data from the CAO Website into a `pandas` dataframe.

It also provides a comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2020 using the funcitionality in `pandas` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

## 3. Install

Python distributions contain commonly used packages and tools. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, provides a large collection of packages.

The notebooks use the following packages, which, if not installed on the user's computer might result in the notebook not functioning as intended:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `regular expressions`
- `requests`
- `datetime`
- `pandas`
- `urllib.request`

If required, Python comes with an inbuilt package management system, pip which can install, update, or delete any official package.

Once installed, the packages must be imported; the notebook includes the necessary code to import all packages, once installed (if installation is required).

## 5. Explore

The first notebook discusses each of the plots in turn. 

The second notebook explains how to load the CAO points data and provides a visualisation on the mean points values. 

## 6. Credits

Much of the coding used in the CAO notebook was taken from the lectures by Ian McLoughlin as part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis course at GMIT which started in September 2021. These lectures provided the main body of coding used to import the data from the CAO website for each of the three years.

Full references for sources used are provided within the notebook.
